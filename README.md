# Hello-GO

Get started with [Go](https://go.dev/).

## The idea

Learning the basics of writing a RESTful web service API with `Go` and the [Gin Web Framework](https://gin-gonic.com/).

## Local test

To keep things simple for the tutorial, youâ€™ll store data in memory. A more typical API would interact with a database.

- run code in the current directory: `go run .`
- use curl to make a request to your running web service: `curl http://localhost:8080/albums`
